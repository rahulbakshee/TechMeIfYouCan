Hello World !!! 

This is the curriculum by Siraj Raval on [Youtube](https://youtu.be/FSe_02FpJas) that I am following right now to learn Computer Vision by starting from the basics and then slowly moving on to the complex concepts. 

The tools I will be using **`python, numpy, openCV, tensorFlow, pyTorch, keras`** etc.

This is a work in progress and I will be updating jupyter notebooks @[this git repo](https://github.com/rahulbakshee/cv/tree/master/Learn_Computer_Vision)

Part 1: Low Level Vision (image > image)
- Week 1 ( Basic Image Processing Techniques)
- Week 2 (Motion and Optical Flow)

Part 2: Mid Level Vision (image > features)
- Week 3 (Basic Segmentation)
- Week 4 (Fitting)

Part 3: Multiple Views
- Week 5 (Multiple Images)
- Week 6 (3D Scenes)

Part 4: High Level Vision (Features > Analysis)
- Week 7 (Object Detection & Classification)
- Week 8 (Modern Deep Learning)


Happy Learning !!!
