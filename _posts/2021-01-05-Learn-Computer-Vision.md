Hello World !!! 

# Learn Computer Vision
This is the curriculum for "Learn Computer Vision" by Siraj Raval on [Youtube](https://youtu.be/FSe_02FpJas). I am trying to learn Computer Vision by starting from the basics and then slowly moving on to complex concepts. 

The tools I will be using **`python, numpy, openCV, tensorFlow, pyTorch, keras`** etc.

for jupyter notebooks visit [git repo](https://github.com/rahulbakshee/cv/tree/master/Learn_Computer_Vision)
