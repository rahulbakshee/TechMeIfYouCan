	<p>I am a Data Scientist working on solving real world problems using Machine Learning and Deep Learning. I have a huge interest in Computer Vision. I keep myself busy in learning and implementing new tools and techniques. In the near future I would like to see myself working on some cool projects such as Autonomous Vehicles, consumer applications in Healthcare etc.</p>
	<p>I am a caring father and a loving husband. I trek a lot and I love travelling. I play badminton on weekends.  </p>
